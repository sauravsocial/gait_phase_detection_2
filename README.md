# gait_phase_detection_2
Detected 7 sub phases of a gait cycle by k-means clustering.


1. Used tri-axial accelerometer data from IMU in the .xlsx format

2. Pre processed data where I used X-axis of the knee data and both X,Y axis of the ankle data and their first order derivatives by three point estimation.


3. set k=7.

4. labelled clusters are saved in cluster_result1.csv
